## Description 
Inspired by an excess of movie watching in quarintine during the COVID 19 pandemic, we have created a fun disctraction from reality, and the tv screen, that will test your movie knowledge on the computer screen! After logging in, you will be directed to the box office where you can choose which movie category to quiz yourself on. Your score will be based off of correct answers and how fast you can answer each question. Once the quiz is complete you will be able to compare your score with other players to see who scored the highest!
## Usage

* Choose the quiz category you wish you play.
* The quiz will cycle through questions as you answer and then direct you to the high scores page. 
* Try the quiz again or logout.
